# Changelog

This file includes a history of past releases. Changes that were not yet added to a release are in the [changelog.d/](./changelog.d) folder.

<!--
⚠️ DO NOT ADD YOUR CHANGES TO THIS FILE! (unless you want to modify existing changelog entries in this file)
Changelog entries are managed by scriv. After you have made some changes to this plugin, create a changelog entry with:

    scriv create

Edit and commit the newly-created file in changelog.d.

If you need to create a new release, create a separate commit just for that. It is important to respect these
instructions, because git commits are used to generate release notes:
  - Modify the version number in `__about__.py`.
  - Collect changelog entries with `scriv collect`
  - The title of the commit should be the same as the new version: "vX.Y.Z".

## v19.0.0 (2024-12-09)

- [Improvement] get rid of of `dockerize`. (by @ghassanmas)

- 💥[Feature] Switch from the legacy `cs_comments_service` Ruby app to the new forum v2 Python app. In addition, forum data is now stored in MySQL, and not in MongoDb. This considerably simplifies this plugin. Change should be transparent for most users, unless the forum backend has been customised in some way. This is considered a breaking change because the legacy forum will no longer be supported by this plugin. Users who want to keep running `cs_comments_service` will have to create their own plugin.

  * Rename **master** to **release**, as this branch runs the latest official Open edX release tag.
  * Rename **nightly** to **main**, as this branch runs the Open edX master branches, which are the basis for the next Open edX release.
